# VLAN Network Setup with Inter-VLAN Routing

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to configure VLANs and enable inter-VLAN routing on a small office network. It includes configurations for network segmentation and basic access control rules.

## Objectives
- Set up VLANs to segment network traffic.
- Configure inter-VLAN routing for communication between departments.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco Switch and Router configurations

## Steps
1. Created a network topology with VLANs for HR, IT, and Sales departments.
2. Configured inter-VLAN routing on the router to enable communication between VLANs.
3. Set up basic security rules to restrict unnecessary traffic between VLANs.
